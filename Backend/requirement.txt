This project code snippet defines several crucial components for a Flask application focused on secure file handling and user management. 
It begins with a `requires_role` decorator that enforces role-based access control, ensuring only users with the appropriate role can access specific views. 
The application connects to a MongoDB database for data storage and retrieval, utilizing a secure connection URI. 
For encryption, it generates an AES-256 key for encrypting files and an RSA key pair for wrapping the AES key, allowing for secure key management and periodic rotation every 12 hours to enhance security. 
Utility functions are included for key derivation, file encryption/decryption, and wrapping/unwrapping keys, while audit logging functions capture user actions to maintain accountability. 
Finally, the Flask app is configured with a secret key for session management and paths for serving frontend assets, creating a secure and organized framework for managing sensitive data.
